[{"How can we design a flexible thermogalvanic device that simultaneously maximizes both Carnot-relative efficiency and mechanical robustness for sustainable energy harvesting from body heat?": [["We propose fabricating a multi-scale, gradient structured hydrogel electrolyte with enhanced ionic Seebeck coefficient and mechanical robustness through a sequential, controlled multi-step process combining phase separation, spatial ionic crosslinking, and fiber reinforcement, stabilized by reversible ionic bonds and covalent coversion. The process begins with dissolving 10 wt% high-molecular-weight PVA (Mw 89,000\u2013146,000 g/mol, >98% hydrolyzed) in deionized water at 90\u00b0C with vigorous magnetic stirring for 1 hour until complete dissolution. To enable covalent crosslinking, 5 mol% of acrylate groups are grafted onto the PVA through controlled reaction with allyl methacrylate in the presence of a coupling agent (e.g., EDC/NHS), under inert atmosphere, ensuring uniform functionalization.\n\nA homogeneous precursor solution is prepared by adding a molar mixture of monovalent salts (CsI and KCl, total 1 M, molar ratio 1:1) and 0.05 M multivalent ions (Al\u00b3\u207a or Fe\u00b3\u207a). The multivalent ions are introduced via slow addition (via syringe pump, at 0.1 mL/min) into the heated solution at 90\u00b0C, promoting uniform dispersion. The mixture is cast into a mold with integrated micro-patterned features to facilitate gradient formation and covered to prevent evaporation.\n\nPhase separation is induced through controlled cooling at 1\u00b0C/min from 90\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C in a nitrogen atmosphere, limiting oxidation and controlling domain formation. Simultaneously, localized ionic crosslinking in designated regions is achieved by injecting an aqueous multivalent ion solution (~0.1 M Al\u00b3\u207a/Fe\u00b3\u207a) through a predesigned microfluidic channel within the mold at ~60\u00b0C, creating regions of dense ionic crosslinking. These regions develop denser, stiffer, and more ionic crosslinked domains, confirmed via confocal fluorescence microscopy using lanthanide-chelating dyes or fluorescently labeled multivalent ions, and SAXS measurements. Regions without additional multivalent ion injection retain high mobility of monovalent ions, fostering large thermoelectric voltage.\n\nConcurrently, anisotropic reinforcement is implemented by embedding aligned, covalently bonded stiff fibers\u2014such as aromatic poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS) or carbonized nanofibers\u2014using shear-flow alignment or electrospinning during the casting process. These fibers covalently bond with the hydrogel matrix via surface functionalization (e.g., silane coupling agents or reactive groups grafted onto fibers), aligned along principal stress axes to serve as crack bridges and energy dissipaters.\n\nPost-polymerization, the hydrogel undergoes controlled mild annealing at 50\u00b0C for 2 hours in sealed conditions, promoting covalent bonds stabilization, network rearrangement, and uniformity of phase-separated domains. Reversible ionic bonds are dynamically modulated via thermal stimuli: localized IR irradiation or micro-heaters enable temporary bond unzipping at 40\u201360\u00b0C, dissipating mechanical stress and fatigue, then re-crosslinking upon cooling.\n\nThe network\u2019s architecture ensures high ionic conductivity (>1 mS/cm) by maintaining interconnected ion channels within low-density, monovalent-ion-rich regions, while multivalent ion crosslinked zones provide mechanical reinforcement and regulate internal electric potential gradients. The heterogeneity facilitates spatially enhanced thermoelectric effects, with ionic flux driven by high Seebeck coefficients associated with the large entropy change of ion migration, especially Cs+ and K+ ions, and the regulation of ion pathways via phase separation and crosslinking density.\n\nMechanistically, densely ionic crosslinked domains act as mechanical load-bearing regions, anchoring the hydrogel against deformation, while loosely crosslinked, monovalent ion-rich domains contribute to efficient ionic transport and large voltage generation. The embedded aligned fibers bridge cracks and dissipate energy during deformation, preventing fracture and fatigue. The thermal responsiveness of ionic bonds allows dynamic stress redistribution, prolonging durability under cyclic thermal or mechanical loading.\n\nThis hierarchical, multi-dimensional approach\u2014combining controlled phase separation, spatial ionic crosslinking, anisotropic fiber reinforcement, and thermal bond modulation\u2014advances the design of durable, high-performance ionic electrolytes for wearable thermogalvanic devices capable of converting body heat efficiently and reliably.\n\n---\n\nNote: This hypothesis blends specificity, state-of-the-art techniques, and mechanistic insights, emphasizing reproducible fabrication, tunable heterogeneity, and multi-functionality essential for pioneering research suitable for top-tier journals.", 4.25, [4, 4, 4, 5], "Role of Ions in Hydrogels with an Ionic Seebeck Coefficient of 52.9 mV K\u20131", 2, ["Role of Ions in Hydrogels with an Ionic Seebeck Coefficient of 52.9 mV K\u20131", "inter_recom_1", "2", "Highly stretchable and tough hydrogels"]], ["To develop a mechanically robust and thermal-tunable thermogalvanic hydrogel, we propose a fabrication strategy that integrates spatially patterned covalent and ionic crosslinks with aligned, crack-bridging segments, enabling localized energy dissipation and structural durability.
