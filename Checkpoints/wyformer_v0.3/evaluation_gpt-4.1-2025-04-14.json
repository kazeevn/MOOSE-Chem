[{"How can we build a generative model based on Wyckoff positions that will faithfully reproduce the distribution of symmetry space groups and outperform the SOTA models in terms of stability, uniqueness, and novelty?": [["We hypothesize that a generative modeling framework integrating comprehensive group-theoretic canonicalization, hierarchical multi-modal architecture, and targeted rare-symmetry augmentation will enable faithful reproduction of symmetry space group distributions in crystalline materials, outperforming previous methods in stability, uniqueness, and novelty of generated structures.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n1. **Group-Theoretic Canonicalization & Data Encoding:**\n   - For each crystal, enumerate all valid group\u2013maximal-subgroup\u2013Wyckoff position chains using spglib and exhaustive custom algorithms. Represent each chain by integer and one-hot tokens: space group, full subgroup chain, Wyckoff letters, atomic species, and site parameters (binned at 0.05 fractional units).\n   - Isomorphism checks (via canonical structure graph hashing) deduplicate entries; for ambiguous or polymorphic cases, every valid chain is recorded, with chain choice prioritized by subgroup length then lexicographic Wyckoff sequence.\n\n2. **Rare Symmetry Class Augmentation:**\n   - Adapt morphological SMOTE: map discrete group/chain classes to a learned embedding (via contrastive or supervised metric learning), interpolate between rare-class vectors in latent space, project results back to valid space group/subgroup/Wyckoff tuples using group-theoretical rules, and rigorously filter non-physical instances.\n   - Augment further via group/subgroup lowering, atomic ordering permutations, and synthetic site parameter variations within physical constraints.\n\n3. **Edge Case and Uncertain Site Handling:**\n   - For partially occupied or mixed Wyckoff positions, encode tokens with a learned uncertainty prior; probabilistic masking distributes generative probability mass across all admissible occupancies. User-configurable filters control strictness for ambiguous entries.\n\n4. **Model Architecture:**\n   - Hierarchical autoregressive transformer stack: (i) group/subgroup transformer (global context); (ii) set-equivariant transformer (Wyckoff/site permutation invariance); (iii) atomic/species/position decoder. At each layer, dynamic masking is enforced based on group/chain/chemical logic.\n   - All hyperparameters, masking protocols, and selection policies are transparently reported and released.\n\n5. **Training, Validation, and Reproducibility:**\n   - Datasets (e.g., MP-20) are split via structure-based clustering. Validation checks include (a) space group distribution fidelity, (b) uniqueness/novelty (crystal graph isomorphism tests within resource limits), and (c) stability (ensemble property surrogate models with error quantification).\n   - Full pipeline (data, code, parameter configs, pre-trained models) is released under an open license. Resource usage (GPU/CPU memory, run time) is reported for each protocol.\n\n6. **Downstream Demonstration:**\n   - Proof-of-concept: use model for targeted generation of low-symmetry, high-functional-score candidates (e.g., for photonic or thermoelectric applications), establishing viability for AI-driven hypothesis generation in unexplored space group regimes.\n\nThis comprehensive, modular design tightly integrates symmetry theory, advanced generative modeling, and explicit rare-class support, forming a foundation for next-generation, symmetry-faithful inorganic material discovery.", 4.25, [4, 4, 4, 5], "Multi-property directed generative design of inorganic materials through Wyckoff-augmented transfer learning", 2, ["Multi-property directed generative design of inorganic materials through Wyckoff-augmented transfer learning", "inter_recom_1", "recom", "Space Group Informed Transformer for Crystalline Materials Generation"]], ["Develop a transformer-based, autoregressive generative model for crystalline materials that explicitly enforces space group and Wyckoff position hierarchy at every generation step, targeting faithful reproduction of symmetry distributions in crystal datasets (e.g., MP-20).

Site coordinates are discretized to 0.05-unit bins; species as categorical tokens.\n   - Special handling for sites with multiple species or partial occupancy: represent as composite tokens, with masking for undefined entries.\n\n2.

Tie-breaking and equivalence are made fully deterministic to ensure single-representation mapping.\n2. **Deterministic Symmetry Augmentation**: For each training structure, all symmetry-equivalent Wyckoff arrangements are generated (using explicit group action pseudo-code), computationally capped for large N (>40) by prioritizing coset representatives based on group-theoretic importance or informativeness. The selected augmentation budget is justified, with fallback rules recorded.\n3. **Set-Equivariant Generative Model**: The model employs a permutation- and group-equivariant set-based neural framework (e.g., Set Transformer with explicit symmetry-aware layers), processing canonicalized Wyckoff sets.

Specifically:\n\n1. Data Representation & Canonicalization: Each crystal is encoded by exhaustive, group-theory-derived maximal subgroup\u2013Wyckoff chains (via an extended spglib+custom enumeration library). All representations are deduplicated using a rigorous graph-based automorphism index, with stochastic tie-breaking resolved deterministically.

Tokens include: space group (1\u2013230, one-hot), chain, site multiplicity, Wyckoff symbol, element, fractional parameter (binned, \u0394x=0.05), and automorphism class.\n\n2. Legal-by-Construction Masking: At every autoregressive decoding step, mask-tensors filter out illegal Wyckoff/site choices using an exhaustive, open-source lookup-table (precomputed for all known space groups via the ITC), dynamically updated for downstream steps. Fractional occupancy and partial disorder are encoded as special-case tokens, with site assignment probabilities proportional to known physical prevalence (default priors provided).\n\n3. Rare Class Augmentation: Rare symmetry/subgroup/element-site combinations are supplemented via a calibrated, SMOTE-inspired protocol: (i) discrete classes embedded (128d vector, learned jointly); (ii) rare-sample pairs interpolated via convex combinations in latent space; (iii) samples mapped back (via ITC lookups) and physically checked for feasibility/admissibility\u2014non-physical or redundant outputs pruned. Augmentation ratios and thresholds are tunable (default: balance within 10% per class).\n\n4. Model Architecture: A modular, three-level architecture is used: (a) symmetry-group transformer (4 layers, 512 hidden units, 8 heads), (b) site-permutation-equivariant transformer (3 layers, 320 units), (c) atom identity/parameter decoder (2 layers, 160 units). Legality masks and automorphism checks are applied at all levels. Hyperparameters (layer counts, dropout rates, batch sizes) are reported with defaults and ablation plans.\n\n5.

DFT-in-the-Loop Feedback: Active learning framework selects diverse, high-uncertainty candidates for DFT (default: 32/epoch, up to 128); results incrementally update stability priors and filter legal mask tables. DFT failures analyzed for error types and fed back for rare-class surrogate retraining. Auxiliary ML potentials (MatBERT, CGCNN) triage and rank candidates for DFT.

The pipeline operates as follows:\n\n1. Data Representation: \n   - All input/output crystal structures are encoded as fixed-length tensors representing site occupancy, coordinate type (special/general), Wyckoff position, atomic species, and partial occupation if present. Canonicalization is achieved via lexicographic ordering with strict tie-breaking on site symmetry and atomic charge balancing protocols; the full mapping is deterministic and resolves all automorphism ambiguities. Reference code and lookup tables use Spglib and Pymatgen.\n   - A precomputed, group-indexed legality mask (dim: max_sites x possible Wyckoff configs x allowed atom types) is constructed for each space group, identifying all symmetry-permissible site arrangements. For groups with site counts exceeding N=12 or memory use >4GB, masks are generated dynamically step-wise; precise fallback triggers are specified in a parameter table (see Supplement I).\n\n2. Model Architecture:\n   - An E(3)-equivariant transformer with group-conditional context embedding drives sequential site placement; each step selects only legal Wyckoff-atom configurations (logits zeroed by legality mask) for the active group. Default architecture parameters: 8 layers, 512 hidden units, GELU activation, with \u03bb-weighted loss (\u03bb_sym, \u03bb_uniq, \u03bb_nov) tuned from pilot runs (defaults: 1, 2, 1).\n   - In-model automorphism marginalization is by stochastic permutation averaging on equivalent site orderings (max 5 per step). For groups/structures where automorphism enumeration exceeds 100, a capped random sample is used (Supplement II).\n   - Partial occupation and disorder are represented explicitly; disorder fractions must match compositional and symmetry constraints at each generative step.\n\n3. Training and Evaluation:\n   - Training is on the MP-20 dataset, ablated by group size, chemical family, and occupation complexity.\n   - During training and sampling, only legal-by-construction steps are permitted; no post-hoc filtering. All outputs are checked for isomorphism (Spglib), group symmetry, chemical plausibility, and uniqueness. Duplicate/isomorphic candidates trigger dynamic penalty during training.\n   - Benchmarks: Compare to DiffCSP, FlowMM, and Kim et al. 2023's symmetry-aware model; report stability, uniqueness, and per-group symmetry-matching rates.\n   - Empirical resource profiling (mask memory, automorphism averaging time), fallback activation rates, and failure analyses are included.\n\n4.

Ablation paths encompass (a) inclusion/exclusion of disorder handling, (b) varying augmentation caps, and (c) alternative equivariant blocks. \n\n4. **Edge-Case Handling:** For ambiguous or mixed-occupancy sites, a reproducibility-logged fallback pipeline assigns output to manual/automated screeners based on defined thresholds. All steps generate auditable records and decision IDs. For partial/noisy data (e.g., incomplete CIFs), a separate imputation/classification preprocessor is invoked, version-logged, and error rates are tabulated across benchmarks.\n\n5. **Automorphism Marginalization & Validation:** Uniqueness and novelty are assessed through scalable, batched graph isomorphism checks (downsampling for N>40), augmented with neural isomorphism surrogates for efficiency. Novelty is quantified by both traditional metrics and the introduced \"symmetry-constrained uniqueness\" score; disorder handling allows for a new \"disorder-resolved novelty\" metric.\n\n6. **Stability Scoring:** Final candidate sets are pre-screened via an ensemble of open-source surrogate models (CGCNN, MEGNet, MatBERT, using fixed, published checkpoints), with disagreement triggering automated flagging and error analyses.\n\n7. **Benchmarking & Application Scenarios:** Reproducibility, scalability, and edge-case robustness are demonstrated on standardized datasets, with open-source artifacts and a leaderboard for community benchmarking.

The methodology is fully specified as follows:\n\n1. **Data Representation and Canonicalization**: All structures are expressed as sequences: (space group index, ordered canonical Wyckoff positions, species, site occupancies). For each input, a group-theoretic canonicalization routine (via spglib) ensures a unique, lossless representation. Automorphism classes of each space group are pre-tabulated; ambiguity cases (multiple Wyckoff representations) are resolved by a sorting and equivalence-checking protocol. Code, canonicalization scripts, and test cases are versioned and provided.\n\n2. **Architecture**: An autoregressive transformer (e.g., 6 layers, model dimension 512, max sequence length 20) is conditioned on explicit property vectors (user-specified or dataset-derived), normalized in [-1,1] and concatenated with positional embeddings. At each decoding step, dynamic legality masks (precomputed/cached for efficiency) are applied based on partial sequences and group-theoretic constraints, excluding illegal continuations in real time.\n\n3. **Stepwise Automorphism Marginalization**: During sequence generation, probabilities are dynamically marginalized over all automorphism-equivalent Wyckoff sequences for the current partial structure.

Parallelization and result caching address computational overhead; per-space-group stats (N_equiv) and operation timings are reported.\n\n4. **Legal-by-Design and Robustness**: All generated structures are legal by construction; illegal or ambiguous sequences trigger fallback heuristics.

Select the lexicographically-minimal encoding; in case of ties, use site point group order (higher symmetry first), then atomic number as final tiebreaker. Refer to attached code stub (see: github.com/[ref]/wyckoff-canonical).\n   - **Ambiguity/Disorder:** For partial occupancies or multi-occupancy, represent as a normalized sum across element one-hot vectors and a separate uncertainty mask channel. Structures with irreducible ambiguity are encoded with a predefined UNTYPED mask and marked for downstream evaluation.\n\n### Model Architecture\n\n3. **Backbone:** Employ an E(3)-equivariant transformer or graph neural network (e.g., e3nn, TensorFieldNet) mapping canonicalized tensors to structure logits.\n   - **Input:** (batch \u00d7 max_spacegroups \u00d7 max_wyckoff_sites \u00d7 site_features)\n   - **Embedding:** Site-wise embeddings summed/pooled across elements for multi-occupancy, with explicit disorder masks.\n   - **Output:** Predict categorical distributions for each site (Wyckoff letter, element) and reals for positional parameters.\n\n4. **Automorphism Marginalization (Group Regularization):**\n   - Regularize prediction loss by marginalizing over a sampled subset (N=K) of automorphic Wyckoff encodings per structure, K tunable per space group; gradients averaged across samples. If group size exceeds threshold (e.g. >500), sample uniformly with fixed random seed for reproducibility.

Design ablation/stress tests by space group size, group complexity, and disorder rate.\n\n### Novelty and Comparisons\n\n7.

Data Representation: Each structure is encoded as (Space Group Number, ordered sequence of Wyckoff positions, mapping of atomic species to positions). For example, \u03b2-quartz (SG No. 180, Wyckoff positions 2a, 4b), with O/SI assignments.\n\n2. Dynamic Lookup Tables: For each space group, a precomputed table from the Bilbao Crystallographic Server enumerates all legal Wyckoff position occupancy patterns and their corresponding symmetry multiplicities. Atomic species assignment is constrained by finite, user-defined stoichiometry and charge-balance lookup rules (e.g., electroneutrality enforced from the ICSD valence database; conflicts are handled by rejecting illegal assignments at generation time).\n\n3. Generative Model: A Transformer-based conditional generative model (embedding space-group and global stoichiometry) produces structure histories stepwise. At each step:\n   a. The model selects a Wyckoff position based on remaining legal occupancy patterns, enforced by a dynamic mask derived from the space-group specific lookup table.\n   b. Masking is recalculated after every decision to disable illegal (by group representation or stoichiometry) branches.\n   c. The assignment of each atomic species to Wyckoff sites is similarly masked by allowed species (by charge, chemistry, rarity, user-specified options).\n   d. In cases of ambiguity (multiple equivalent representations for the same structure), all canonical forms are disallowed except the lex smallest by predefined rule (to avoid redundancy).\n\nExample (P2\u2081/c, SG No. 14): Given SiO2, valid Wyckoff patterns (e.g., {2e, 4f}) are drawn via mask; the model assigns O and Si steps, with illegal charge/compositional candidates masked dynamically. If no valid step exists due to constraint collision, sampling aborts and restarts.\n\n4. Training and Preprocessing: Training uses all unique, physically plausible structures from the Materials Project. To address rare space groups, synthetic data augmentation is applied uniformly based on space-group frequency, down-weighted by occupancy entropy to avoid overfitting. Low-occupancy and edge-case groups undergo oversampling, with masking tuned to prevent mode collapse.\n\n5. Benchmarking: The model\u2019s validity (symmetry legality, chemical/charge balance), uniqueness, and diversity are evaluated by (a) comparing generated structure distributions with the real dataset, (b) direct side-by-side benchmarking with DiffCSP, FlowMM, and automorphism-marginalizing baselines, and (c) human- and algorithm-aided identification and quantification of ambiguous Wyckoff representations. A subset (~1000) is evaluated by automated DFT (fixed VASP settings: PBE, E_cut=520 eV, k-points 0.03 \u212b\u207b\u00b9), and phonon stability checks are performed.\n\n6.

Each sample is stored with all its automorphs for contrastive learning.\n   - Mask illegal Wyckoff motifs by empirical occurrence (mask = 1 if observed; optionally, allow rare/unseen patterns with low sampling probability and flag for analysis).\n   \n2. Model Architecture\n   - Backbone: Conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) with two disentangled latent codes:\n     \u2022 z_sym: symmetry/action code, trained for invariance to automorphic input encodings\n     \u2022 z_struct: site/species code, capturing structure given fixed symmetry.\n   - Encoder/decoder built with message-passing neural networks (e3nn or EGNN) for permutation and rotation robustness.\n   - Group classifier/discriminator auxiliary head predicts space group from z_sym for disentanglement control.\n\n3. Loss Functions and Training\n   - Reconstruction loss on Wyckoff/sites/species.\n   - Contrastive/triplet loss over automorph pairs: lattices derived from automorphic representations mapped to nearby z_sym, separated from z_sym of non-automorphic crystals (margin=0.5).\n   - KL divergence and auxiliary cross-entropy for group classification.\n   - Chemical plausibility regularizer ensures valence, charge neutrality, and allowed site occupancies (enforced by predictor or rule-based filter).\n   - Ablation: train variants with differing automorph caps, with/without rare Wyckoff patterns, and with/without chemical filtering.\n\n4. Sampling and Generation\n   - During generation, sample space group, then sample legal Wyckoff patterns (with optional rare pattern exploration). Assign atomic types by learned composition model.\n   - Assign candidate fractional site coordinates consistent with Wyckoff constraints.\n   - Filter outputs post hoc by chemical plausibility predictor.\n   - For each structure: (i) evaluate symmetry (by Spglib), (ii) uniqueness (by structure hashes), (iii) stability (by surrogate ML potential or DFT for subset), and (iv) phonon stability (for select cases).\n   - Record and report the frequency and characteristics of out-of-distribution (unseen) Wyckoff patterns.\n   \n5.

Use statistical tests and visual inspection for z_sym/z_struct independence.\n   \n6. Comparative Validation\n   - Include a comparison table to top 3\u20135 recent group-theoretic/categorical crystal generative models (see supplemental), highlighting differences in data representation, automorph handling, latent modeling, and post-processing pipeline.\n\n7.

This hypothesis is implemented by the following methodological innovations:\n\n1. Representation: Crystal structures are encoded as sets of Wyckoff position assignments and atomic properties. We explicitly enumerate the Wyckoff equivalence group G for each space group, using the Bilbao Crystallographic Server or in-house symmetry libraries. Structures are organized into equivalence classes under G.\n\n2. Model Architecture: We use a permutation-invariant deep neural network (e.g., Set Transformer or Deep Sets), where the output distribution p_gen(S) of any structure S satisfies p_gen(S) = p_gen(g\u00b7S) for all g in G.

Our methodology comprises the following steps:\n\n1. Data preprocessing: (a) For every structure in the dataset (e.g., MP-20/OQMD), compute its space group and assign all atoms to Wyckoff positions using spglib. (b) Canonicalize the Wyckoff assignment: For each space group, generate all symmetry-equivalent graphs (node: Wyckoff label + multiplicity + element; edge: symmetry relations), then select the lex smallest via NAUTY with numerical tie-breaking on fractional atomic coordinates. (Pseudocode: construct all graph isomorphs, sort by (space group, Wyckoff letter order, element, position precision); break ties by sum-of-coordinates; report ambiguity if partial/disordered occupancy is present, and log such cases for exclusion or special handling.)\n\n2. Wyckoff graph representation: Nodes encode (Wyckoff letter, multiplicity, element type, occupancy); edges encode symmetry equivalence and, for ambiguous sites (e.g. split occupancy), an explicit flag. Partial/disordered sites are logged and optionally masked during training.\n\n3. Dynamic output masking: For a given partially-decoded structure (prefix), at each autoregressive step, construct a binary mask over next valid Wyckoff-site-element pairs from the space group\u2019s allowed list. Masks are computed using a fast lookup for common groups, with on-the-fly evaluation otherwise. For ambiguous/split Wyckoff positions, masks permit all consistent completions; violations emit soft penalties during training.\n\n4. Model architecture: An autoregressive transformer with position-wise learned embeddings (for space group, Wyckoff site, element), combined with edge encodings, is trained to predict the canonical Wyckoff graph ordering. Layer/hyperparameter suggestion: 6 layers, 8 heads, embedding dim 256. Output is masked as above at every step.\n\n5. Loss structure: a) Symmetry-permutation invariance is enforced with a DeepSets-style loss: L_pi = min_{pi in S_n} L(batch, pi(batch)). b) For uniqueness, an InfoNCE contrastive loss is used: positive samples are alternate canonicalizations of the same structure; negatives are structures from other batches. c) Output-level masking violation is penalized with a soft constraint: L_mask = ||1 - mask(p)|>0||_1, summed across decoding steps.\n\n6. Training protocol: AdamW optimizer, learning rate 1e-4, batch size 32, 5% dropout. During each batch, balance space group prevalence to prevent mode collapse.\n\n7.

Data Representation and Equivalence Class Construction:\n- For each crystal structure (from MP-20 or similar datasets), enumerate all Wyckoff representations corresponding to its space group using spglib's get_symmetry_dataset function (standard settings) and pymatgen for structural parsing. Structures exceeding 20 atoms/unit cell or more than 6 unique Wyckoff positions undergo max N=10 sampling of non-redundant representations by random symmetry operations and uniqueness checks.\n- Represent each structure as a (i) space group number (scalar), (ii) set of equivalence-class Wyckoff assignments (as adjacency tensors or labeled bipartite graphs: dimensions [W, S], W=number of Wyckoff sites, S=species), and (iii) coordinates of symmetry-inequivalent atoms.\n- Canonicalization: Each Wyckoff configuration is hashed using Weisfeiler-Lehman graph hashes (networkx); structures are considered unique if hash(h(structure_A)) != hash(h(structure_B)).\n\n2.

Layered attention segregates each modality, with explicit masking from pretabulated group/subgroup transitions.

The essential methodological components are as follows:\n\n1. Data Representation & Preprocessing: \n  - For each crystal, enumerate up to N_symm (e.g., 2\u20138) symmetry-equivalent Wyckoff position encodings using a group-theoretic library (e.g., spglib). These are treated as categorical variables via one-hot or learned embedding (dimension d_W), with fractional coordinates and occupancy represented as float vectors.\n  - Property labels (space group, band gap, formation energy, etc.) are concatenated as continuous/categorical embeddings or modulated via FiLM layers in the conditional model.\n  - Partial Wyckoff occupation is treated as a mask or via a special token in the encoder.\n\n2. Model Architecture:\n  - The generator is a conditional diffusion model, taking as input: randomly chosen Wyckoff encoding from the equivalence set, associated atomic features, and target/predicted property vectors.\n  - All outputs and contrastive representations are passed through a permutation-invariant pooling function (e.g., DeepSets with median or mean aggregation).\n  - Property conditioning is performed via concatenation or FiLM-like modulation at each layer.\n\n3. Training Objective:\n  - Main generative objective: maximize the log-probability of valid crystal structures conditional on the property vector and Wyckoff encoding.\n  - Multi-view contrastive objective: for each training batch, treat symmetry-equivalent representations as positive pairs and negatives as (i) other crystals, (ii) hard negatives sampled within the same space group but differing Wyckoff configuration. InfoNCE loss is used, with multi-positive handling across equivalence views. Hard negatives are mined via property and space-group proximity heuristics.\n  - Final loss: weighted sum of likelihood and contrastive objectives (\u03b1_contrast in [0.1, 1.0]), tuned during ablation.\n\n4. Generation and Consensus Filtering:\n  - At sampling time, for each target property set, generate K_attempts structures starting from different random seeds and symmetry-equivalent encodings.\n  - For each generated structure, apply spglib to verify symmetry and enumerate the full equivalence set; pass all views through property predictors.\n  - Use majority-vote or median aggregation over equivalence views for assigned space group and properties; a consensus filter (tolerance threshold \u03c4_prop, e.g., 5\u201310% error) retains only those with consistent predictions across views.\n  - To preserve diversity and avoid mode collapse, monitor distributional spread before/after consensus filtering and allow adjustable \u03c4_prop.\n\n5. Prior Work Positioning and Ablation:\n  - Clearly distinguish this hypothesis from prior approaches: past models either use data augmentation, canonicalization, or invariant layers, but none employ real-time, multi-view contrastive training and consensus filtering over true symmetry-equivalence classes in property-conditional generative models.\n  - Propose ablation studies: (a) canonicalization vs. data augmentation vs. multi-view contrast, (b) with/without consensus filtering, (c) with different hard negative mining heuristics.\n\n6. Benchmarking:\n  - Evaluate on Materials Project and OQMD datasets. Metrics: space group fidelity, fraction of unique/valid structures, property prediction consistency, computational resource usage.\n\nThe hypothesis is thus operationalized for direct empirical testing, and every methodological decision is clearly specified to enable reproducibility and meaningful benchmarking.", 2.5, [3, 2, 2, 3], "Multi-property directed generative design of inorganic materials through Wyckoff-augmented transfer learning", 1, ["Multi-property directed generative design of inorganic materials through Wyckoff-augmented transfer learning", "2"]]]}]
