[{"How can we build a generative model based on Wyckoff positions that will faithfully reproduce the distribution of symmetry space groups and outperform the SOTA models in terms of stability, uniqueness, and novelty?": [["We hypothesize that a modular, hybrid generative model for crystal structures\u2014combining alternating space-group-conditioned sequence and set-equivariant blocks, online legality prediction, and rigorous canonicalization\u2014will faithfully reproduce the empirical distribution of symmetry space groups and outperform state-of-the-art models in stability, uniqueness, and novelty. \n\n1. Data Representation & Canonicalization: Crystal structures are encoded via (space group, Wyckoff position sequences, atomic species, and positional parameters). Canonicalization enforces uniqueness using a lex-minimization algorithm over Wyckoff label permutations and atomic site order, implemented with crystallographic libraries (e.g., spglib/pymatgen) and a deterministic tiebreaker protocol for partial occupancies and ambiguous cases. Structures that cannot be uniquely canonicalized (e.g., unresolved disorder) are flagged for exclusion in uniqueness evaluation and further studied for robustness.\n\n2. Model Architecture: The generative model stacks alternating blocks: (a) sequence modules (transformer layers conditioned on space group embeddings, enabling group-specialized attention) and (b) set-equivariant layers (e.g., e3nn or set transformer) operating on Wyckoff and atomic site sets. Interleaved cross-attention enables explicit message passing between sequence and set representations. Group heads share parameters via a conditional embedding strategy, allowing scalability across frequent and rare space groups.\n\n3. Legality Masking: At each generation step, permitted Wyckoff moves are enforced via the differentiable union of hard-rule masks (from crystallographic constraints) and MLP-based learned legality predictors. Gradients flow through the MLP branch, supporting end-to-end training. If no legal moves are available, generation terminates early and the attempt is flagged for data augmentation.\n\n4. Objective Functions: The model is trained with: (a) symmetry-aware NLL for autoregressive outputs, (b) batch-wise uniqueness loss penalizing symmetry-equivalent duplicates, (c) distribution-matching Earth Mover\u2019s Distance loss for generated vs. empirical Wyckoff/space-group frequencies, and (d) optional auxiliary losses for structure stability or other properties.\n\n5. Training, Evaluation, and Ablation: The protocol includes fully specified preprocessing (using MP-20 or relevant materials datasets), train/validation/test/OOD split logic (with rare group stratification), full subroutine pseudocode (canonicalization, legality masking, sampling, augmentation), and documented axes of ablation (fusion logic, legality enforcement, group specialization, loss components).

Canonical tuple is lex-minimized over all symmetry-equivalent Wyckoff orderings, e.g., for space group 221: [('a',1,Ca),('b',1,Ti),('c',3,O)] becomes [('a',1,Ca),('b',1,Ti),('c',3,O)]. Only a unique tuple is kept for each structure.\n   - Partial occupancies/disorder are discretized into multi-label entries or filtered as appropriate.\n   - Apply on-the-fly group-theoretical symmetry augmentation: each batch contains N (e.g., 8\u201316) random symmetry-augmented variants.\n2. **Model Architecture**\n   - Discrete generator (conditional autoregressive transformer): predicts Wyckoff site tuple, conditioned on group embedding (size 128), using 4 transformer layers (8 heads, 256-dim emb).\n   - Continuous generator (SE(3)-equivariant GNN): inputs predicted tuple and generates asymmetric unit coordinates, with group-specific conditioning (as embedding, concatenated to node features). 5 graph layers, 128-dim node states.\n   - Joint latent space is regularized for mutual information between tuple and coordinate embeddings (using CLUB estimator, optimized with gradient descent).\n   - Symmetry group label is available to both discrete and continuous stages and during augmentation.\n3. **Losses & Deduplication**\n   - Cross-entropy for tuple prediction, MSE for coordinates, augmented with permutation- and orbit-invariant matching (Hungarian/Monte Carlo for orbits; fallback to MC for >12 Wyckoff positions/group).\n   - Auxiliary property-prediction loss: property surrogate (CGCNN, refit on MP-2022 for generated data distribution).\n   - Symmetry-aware uniqueness loss: penalizes latent collisions after canonicalization.\n4. **Filtering & Evaluation**\n   - Prior to DFT validation, rank by surrogate (CGCNN) stability.

Performance benchmarks are reported as average/worst-case over the training dataset.\n\n2. Model Architecture:\n- The backbone is a masked transformer encoder with standard multi-head self-attention and token/positional embeddings for group, Wyckoff labels, atomic type, occupancy, and coordinates.\n- Group-conditional heads: Each crystallographic space group either receives a dedicated output head (if sample count exceeds threshold N) or shares a head with similar groups using parameter sharing and group embedding vectors.

Further filters (e.g., minimum bond valence sum deviation or void detection) may be applied optionally at generation or post-processing stages.\n\n3. **Model Architecture**\n   - **Encoder:** A group-equivariant graph neural network (SE(3)-equivariant or, for higher accuracy, explicitly tailored to the space group G) with 3\u20136 layers and 64\u2013256 hidden features processes (P, W, G) into an invariant latent representation.\n   - **Decoder:** Either an autoregressive Transformer or diffusion model (with 4\u201312 layers), operating over indices in the symmetry-orbit space rather than a canonical Wyckoff labeling. Symmetry group G is incorporated as a conditioning variable via learned embeddings.\n\n4. **Orbit-Invariant Loss Function**\n   - For each generated structure, orbit-invariant comparison to target is performed: all group-equivalent (P', W') forms are generated, canonical representatives are sampled, and pairwise root-mean-square distances (RMSD) (or feature-space similarity) are minimized using the Hungarian algorithm for label/permutation ambiguity, constrained to symmetry-allowed mappings.\n   - The loss averages over a stochastic sample of orbit representatives if full enumeration is infeasible (scaling: O(N_atoms \u00d7 |G|)).\n\n5. **Training and Computational Protocol**\n   - Datasets are loaded in batches, to fit within \u226432 GB GPU memory for standard sets (~5,000\u201350,000 structures).

The model is trained via Adam optimizer (lr=1e-4, weight_decay=1e-2), batch size 128.\n\n**3. Training Objective:**\n- Loss function is permutation-invariant (DeepSets sum or mean aggregation of sequence-level likelihoods, plus a contrastive loss between generated and canonical representations). When equivalence-class augmentation is used, random augmentation is applied per epoch, and augmented samples are shuffled across batches. Training, validation, and test splits are 80/10/10%, held fixed with a designated random seed.\n\n**4. Edge Cases and Failure Handling:**\n- If a legality mask blocks all next-token choices, generation is terminated for that structure (early stopping), and the sequence is marked as invalid. Rejection sampling is used up to 5 times to recover a legal path per generation.\n\n**5. Screening/Benchmarking:**\n- After model generation, structures are canonicalized and checked for uniqueness using symmetry-invariant graph hash functions.

The model is defined as follows:\n\n1. **Representation:** Each crystal is represented by (a) a starting space group G (from standard tables), (b) a path P = (G \u2192 H_1 \u2192 ... \u2192 1) traversing the subgroup lattice, with one descent per step, (c) at each node, a set of Wyckoff sites (discrete, categorical), (d) for each site, associated continuous positional parameters and (optional) orientational degrees of freedom, (e) a mapping of chemical species to sites, and (f) additional constraints such as charge neutrality.\n\n2. **Generative Process:**\n  a. The top-level model samples space group G and, conditional on G, learns a probability distribution over permissible subgroup paths P using an autoregressive transformer (with a masking mechanism to eliminate forbidden or trivial paths, and learned probabilities to match observed dataset path frequencies).\n  b. For each node in P, the model samples occupied Wyckoff sites via a categorical distribution parameterized by the context (site symmetries, path history, chemical context). Discrete Wyckoff letters are sampled sequentially, with site splitting allowed as per group theory rules.\n  c. For each occupied site, continuous Wyckoff parameters are sampled via a conditional normalizing flow (e.g., Masked Autoregressive Flow), conditioned on group, site symmetry, and chemical context.

Chemical species assignment per site is generated with masking for allowed valence and site multiplicity, and hard-masked for overall charge neutrality at each step.\n\n3. **Symmetry-Equivalence Management:** Canonicalization is applied after each generative step using Spglib to map the current configuration to a representative canonical form. For efficiency, a local cache is maintained for duplicate configurations, and batch hash-mapping is employed for large scale sampling. Site splitting and merging are equivalence-checked using site permutation graphs.\n\n4. **Model Training:**\n  a. Training data is derived from Materials Project and OQMD, with group-subgroup paths computed via symmetry analysis.

Training and Fallback Protocols:**\n- Training/validation/test splits are stratified by space group (algorithm detailed in supplement).\n- If legality masking results in a dead end (no valid moves), fallback protocol relaxes constraints in a ranked order (first radii, then charge, then symmetry), with each relaxation tracked per sample; threshold limits are specified (e.g., radii relaxed up to +10%, charge up to \u00b12e).\n- Optionally, issue a diagnostic if >20% of generations require fallback or record fallback rate in evaluation.\n\n**5. Evaluation and Benchmarking:**\n- Output samples benchmarked versus SOTA on: (a) symmetry fidelity (space group matching with structure inspector), (b) uniqueness (fraction of unique Wyckoff classes), (c) redundancy (repeats within generated set), and (d) stability (ML proxy, e.g., OQMD GNN \u2265 conventional threshold, and spot-checked DFT energies).\n- All code, pseudocode (for canonicalization, masking, fallback logic), data splits, and lookup tables are open-sourced for full reproducibility.\n\nThis modular, canonical, legality-masked, and permutation-invariant framework constitutes a reproducible, novel generative approach for crystal structure design.", 3.75, [4, 3, 3, 5], "Space Group Informed Transformer for Crystalline Materials Generation", 1, ["Space Group Informed Transformer for Crystalline Materials Generation", "recom"]], ["We hypothesize that a transformer-based autoregressive generative model utilizing stepwise canonicalized Wyckoff position sequences, combined with explicit multi-domain chemical and symmetry constraint masking during decoding, will yield higher rates of unique, symmetric, and chemically valid crystalline materials compared to previous SOTA models.\n\nMethodology:\n\n1. Data Encoding and Canonical Wyckoff Representation\n- Each crystal in the dataset is represented as an ordered sequence of (space group, Wyckoff letter, multiplicity, atomic species).\n- Canonicalization is strictly defined: (a) Wyckoff sites are ordered first by decreasing multiplicity, then alphabetically, then by atomic species lex order; (b) For symmetry-equivalent arrangements, the lexicographically minimal permutation is selected using atomic Z ordering as final tie-breaker.\n- When multiple valid equivalences arise (e.g., for high-symmetry space groups), the canonical label is uniquely assigned via recursive mapping to the minimal site label list, not relying on external libraries.\n- Detailed pseudocode for the canonicalization protocol is provided, including handling edge cases and ambiguous site assignments.\n\n2. Real-Time Constraint Masking During Autoregressive Decoding\n- At each token generation step, output candidates (atomic species, Wyckoff letter, site occupancy) are filtered using a masking function integrating:\n    * Chemical valency compatibility: Dynamic oxidation state tracker updates charge with each assignment, enforcing global electroneutrality and using ICSD/Mp-inferred oxidation states.\n    * Structural compatibility: Space group/Wyckoff occupation rules from Bilbao server/manual tables.\n    * Geometric feasibility: Atomic radius sum constraints (Shannon radii, <10% over/under tolerance) for neighbor pairs considered at each partial structure step.\n    * Site preference: Empirical rules per IUPAC and literature, e.g., transition metals in octahedral sites (pre-encoded by site symmetry label), with curator-defined adjustable thresholds.\n- Masking remains modular, with tunable strictness, logged masking rates, and mask/proposal ratio tracked for each class/space group.\n\n3. Dead-End Handling and Sampling Logic\n- If the candidate mask is empty (dead-end), rollback occurs: beam search with empirically-tuned width (e.g., 32\u2013256) is deployed, prioritizing high-likelihood prefix continuations; generation retries are capped at N=4 per structure (configurable).\n- All generation attempts and rollbacks are logged for error analysis; no invalid structure is finalized.\n\n4. Training Routine and Augmentation\n- Model is trained with canonicalized sequences only; label permutation augmentation is limited to synthetic non-canonical orderings which are reverted for loss computation, guaranteeing unambiguous mapping between input and canonical target.\n- Auxiliary loss for rule violation is set to a weight of 0.2 (tunable) and makes use of constraint violation counters updated at each decoding step.\n\n5.

Tabulated protocol comparisons are provided.\n\nCodebase for canonicalization and masking modules will be supplied for community transparency and validation.", 3.5, [4, 3, 3, 4], "Space Group Informed Transformer for Crystalline Materials Generation", 1, ["Space Group Informed Transformer for Crystalline Materials Generation", "0"]], ["---\n**Hypothesis:**\nA generative model for crystalline solids using canonicalized Wyckoff representations and explicit space group conditioning can be constructed with the following methodological pipeline, yielding symmetry-faithful, stable, unique, and novel materials superior to existing SOTA.\n\n**1.
