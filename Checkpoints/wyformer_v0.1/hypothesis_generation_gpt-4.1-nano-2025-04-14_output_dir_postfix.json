The inspiration from the literature involves multi-property directed generative design utilizing Wyckoff-position-based data augmentation and transfer learning to handle data scarcity and multi-objective constraints. Previous hypotheses focused on integrating this inspiration through mechanisms like symmetry-aware encoders, detailed data augmentation, and transfer learning. To propose a novel approach, the new hypothesis should leverage the core idea of the chain rule from the inspiration but apply it in a different methodological framework that directly addresses the property-conditioned generation process. Instead of merely augmenting data or fine-tuning models, the new hypothesis will incorporate a modular, property-specific gradient-guided generative process, inspired by the chain rule, which propagates property-specific constraints through a multi-level decomposition of the generation process. This approach involves designing a generator network that produces initial candidate structures, then employs parallel property-specific evaluators whose gradients backpropagate through the generator, akin to the chain rule, to iteratively refine the structure toward satisfying multiple property constraints. This process explicitly models the dependencies among properties and structure features, allowing the refinement of candidate materials by simultaneously updating them to optimize for stability, uniqueness, and novelty conditioned on the properties. This method exploits the mathematical principle underlying the chain rule, where gradients of each property inform adjustments across different levels of the generation process, ensuring a structured and interpretable multi-objective optimization pathway.

The model learns to generate descriptors conditioned on target properties, respecting symmetry and periodicity invariances inherently embedded in the descriptors. During inference, the trained diffusion model samples descriptor vectors that encode candidate structures with specified properties.

The model decomposes a crystal into two key components: the asymmetric unit (the minimal atomic configuration from which the full crystal can be generated via symmetry transformations) and the associated symmetry operations. The asymmetric unit is represented as a set of atomic positions and types within a primitive cell, modeled using a graph neural network (GNN) that encodes atomic identities, interatomic bonds, and geometric relationships. Symmetry operations are parameterized as transformation matrices constrained to belong to crystallographic space groups; these are represented via parameterizations that enforce orthogonality, rotation, reflection, and translation properties consistent with crystallographic symmetries, ensuring valid operations within the space group constraints.\n\nThe joint distribution of the asymmetric unit and symmetry operations is learned through a diffusion process. This process involves progressively noising the data and then learning to denoise samples conditioned on desired physical and chemical properties\u2014such as stability metrics, composition, or targeted space groups. During training, the diffusion model learns the gradient of the data distribution over the combined space of atomic configurations and symmetry transformations, capturing their correlations. \n\nTo ensure chemical realism, the model incorporates explicit constraints during sampling. This can be achieved through a learned energy-based potential (e.g., a GNN trained to predict energy and validate bond length distributions and valency rules) integrated into an importance sampling or Langevin dynamics step. When generating a sample, the process begins with a noise vector fixed by the condition and iteratively refines the asymmetric unit and symmetry transformation parameters, applying rejection or projection steps to enforce bond length distributions, preferred coordination environments, and valency constraints.\n\nThe conditioned sampling allows the generation of crystal structures with specific properties\u2014e.g., stability or functional relevance\u2014while inherently preserving realistic symmetry and chemical rules.

The previous methods introduced a diffusion-based approach that explicitly models symmetry components\u2014namely, the asymmetric unit and symmetry transformations\u2014and learns their joint distribution. Past hypotheses primarily integrated the symmetry information directly into the diffusion process, either by modeling the joint distribution or by explicitly controlling the symmetry invariants during generation. To develop a novel hypothesis, I considered leveraging the core inspiration\u2014the explicit, interpretable representation of symmetry transformations\u2014and thought about shifting the methodological emphasis from directly modeling symmetry to embedding the symmetry and unit cell parameters into an equivariant learning framework. By doing so, the model would respect symmetry invariances inherently, rather than explicitly encoding or decomposing them during generation. This leads to a hypothesis where the generation process is designed to produce crystal structures via an equivariant neural network that inherently encodes symmetry properties; the model learns to generate asymmetric units and lattice parameters simultaneously while maintaining equivariance to symmetry operations. During training, the model learns a structured latent space that respects crystallographic symmetry, facilitating the generation of novel crystals with the desired properties. This approach not only integrates the symmetry preservation more intrinsically but also leverages the mathematical framework of equivariance to guarantee that generated structures automatically satisfy symmetry constraints without explicit post-processing or separate modeling of symmetry transformations. This represents a distinct methodological shift from prior hypotheses that focus on modeling symmetry transformations explicitly within a diffusion framework, to embedding symmetry constraints directly into the model architecture through equivariant design, which inherently respects the symmetries. The approach would include designing an equivariant generator conditioned on unit cell parameters, employing equivariant loss functions that penalize deviations from symmetry invariance, and enforcing chemical validity through domain-specific constraints embedded within the model architecture.

Specifically, the model utilizes an equivariant generator trained on a dataset of known crystal structures, where the network architecture is designed to be equivariant under the action of crystallographic symmetry groups. During training, the model learns to encode the asymmetric unit and lattice parameters into a latent space while preserving their symmetry relationships as dictated by group theory. In the generation phase, sampling from the latent space produces asymmetric units and lattice parameters directly, with the equivariance property ensuring that the symmetry of the generated structure is inherently preserved without explicit encoding of symmetry transformations. The model further incorporates chemical validity constraints through embedded domain-specific loss functions that penalize chemically infeasible configurations. Once trained, this model can generate novel crystalline structures by sampling latent vectors conditioned on desired properties, with the generated asymmetric units automatically respecting the specified symmetry constraints, leading to stable and realistic crystal structures that exhibit physically consistent symmetry operations and material properties.

The previous methods incorporated symmetry explicitly through a diffusion model that decomposes crystals into asymmetric units and symmetry transformations, emphasizing the geometric and symmetry aspects. The core inspiration from SymmCD utilizes a structure-aware diffusion process that explicitly models symmetry-aware components. To develop a novel hypothesis, I will leverage the concept of energy-based modeling combined with the symmetry decomposition.

The core premise involves selecting and utilizing differentiable structural descriptors that encode periodicity, symmetries, and invariances intrinsic to crystalline lattices\u2014such as symmetry-adapted graph-based embeddings or Minkowski functionals\u2014ensuring the representation reflects physically meaningful features. These descriptors are designed to be invariant under translations, rotations, and permutations, and are differentiable to facilitate gradient-based optimization.\n\nThe training process begins by extracting such descriptors from a curated dataset of known crystal structures. A neural network-based diffusion model\u2014structured, for instance, as a U-Net or denoising autoencoder\u2014performs stochastic denoising in this descriptor space. The model is trained to gradually learn the distribution of descriptors corresponding to physically valid structures by adding controlled Gaussian noise at varying levels and learning to denoise at each step, thereby capturing the underlying distribution's topology.\n\nFor generation, the diffusion process starts from pure Gaussian noise in the descriptor space. The trained diffusion network iteratively refines this noisy input to produce plausible, low-noise descriptors encoding candidate crystal structures respecting the physical invariances. To reconstruct the actual atomic positions and lattice parameters, a gradient-based optimization is employed. Specifically, a reconstruction loss\u2014defined as the difference between the generated descriptor and the descriptor of a candidate structure\u2014is minimized with respect to atomic coordinates and lattice vectors. This optimization enforces the structural realism and physical plausibility by incorporating boundary conditions for periodicity and invariance constraints.\n\nCrucially, this methodology ensures the generated structures inherently respect symmetry and periodic boundary conditions, addressing a persistent challenge in crystal structure generation. To validate the generated structures\u2019 stability and realism, they are post-processed via first-principles calculations (e.g., density functional theory), phonon spectrum analysis for dynamical stability, and property evaluations such as formation energies. This validation step ensures the physical relevance of the generated samples.\n\nThe novelty resides in the integration of physics-based, invariant descriptors within a diffusion modeling pipeline, combined with a reconstruction step explicitly handled via gradient-based optimization. This strategy significantly differs from direct atom or structure generation methods by operating entirely within a descriptor space that encodes essential invariances, thus simplifying model training and ensuring generated structures adhere to physical constraints. It also addresses existing limitations by providing a flexible, generalizable framework adaptable to various classes of crystalline materials.\n\nIn summary, this hypothesis posits that by embedding crystalline structures into a carefully chosen, physics-informed invariant representation space, leveraging diffusion models to cover the distribution of these representations, and employing robust gradient-based reconstruction techniques, one can generate diverse, stable, and physically plausible crystalline structures respecting all relevant symmetries, boundary conditions, and periodicities.", "Thank you for providing such a detailed and comprehensive research hypothesis.

First, the descriptors\u2014such as symmetry-adapted graph embeddings or Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP)\u2014are computed with explicit parameters, including local cutoff radii and normalization schemes, to encode periodic and invariant representations of crystal structures. A neural diffusion model, composed of residual convolutional layers with self-attention modules, is trained to learn the distribution of these descriptors across diverse crystalline datasets using a combined loss function incorporating mean squared error and perceptual similarity metrics. The diffusion process adds controlled Gaussian noise to the descriptors over multiple timesteps, and the trained model learns to iteratively denoise them, enabling the sampling of new, physically plausible descriptors, with noise schedules carefully tuned for stability and diversity. For reconstruction, a gradient-based optimization algorithm recovers atomic positions from sampled descriptors by minimizing the discrepancy between the generated descriptor and the target descriptor, subject to physical constraints such as periodic boundary conditions and translational invariance.

The previous methods focus on using invariant descriptors within a diffusion framework, reconstructing atomic positions via gradient-based optimization, and working directly in a representation space that respects material symmetries. Prior hypotheses have integrated the diffusion process within this invariant descriptor space or utilized such descriptors as intermediates. To generate a distinct methodology, I propose leveraging the core idea of the chain rule and differential invariance from the inspiration, but applied differently. Instead of generating in the descriptor space or Cartesian space, the new hypothesis involves generating a parameterized potential energy surface directly conditioned on the invariant descriptors. This potential, once sampled, guides the atomic arrangement via specialized gradient flows, thus incorporating the physical principles through energy minimization. This approach emphasizes a hybrid generative-optimization process that explicitly models the energetics instead of mere structural descriptors, thereby better ensuring stability and realism. The process entails first encoding known stable structure datasets into a parameterized energy function that inherently respects symmetries\u2014such as using a sum over symmetry-adapted basis functions\u2014and employing a diffusion process over energy function parameters conditioned on the invariant descriptors. Then, during generation, a stochastic diffusion modifies these parameters within their invariant space, guided by the physical invariances. After the diffusion process, the learned energy function is used to perform gradient-based optimization to find the atomic structure that minimizes this energy, effectively reconstructing a physically meaningful, stable crystal. This approach benefits from incorporating physical invariance directly into the energy landscape, thus inherently promoting stability and realistic configurations. Moreover, by diffusing the energy parameters conditioned on the descriptors, the method can generate diverse yet physically consistent structures without explicit adjacency or raw Cartesian data. Validation involves comparing the generated structures\u2019 stability, uniqueness, and realism through energy assessments, phonon stability calculations, and chemical validity checks. This methodology distinctly combines an invariant-symmetry-aware diffusion over energy functions with reconstruction via physics-informed gradient optimization, differing from previous descriptor or Cartesian space diffusion methods, and leveraging the chain rule's conceptual foundation for the differentiability and invariance in the energy-based model.", "This hypothesis proposes to generate crystalline materials by first constructing a parameterized potential energy surface that inherently satisfies the symmetries, periodicity, and invariances of the material space, using an invariant basis informed by the structures\u2019 descriptors. The parameters of this energy function are then diffused through a stochastic, physics-informed diffusion process within the invariant parameter space, conditioned explicitly on the prior knowledge embedded in the descriptors. During diffusion, the energy parameters evolve under a defined stochastic differential equation designed to preserve physical invariances via the differentiable properties of the invariant basis, effectively performing a symmetry-preserving diffusion over the energy landscape. Post-diffusion, the generated set of energy function parameters serve as a physically meaningful model of the potential landscape. To reconstruct a stable crystal structure, a gradient-based energy minimization is performed starting from an initial configuration (e.g., random or templated), using the diffused energy function to evaluate stability and forces. This optimization seeks atomic arrangements that correspond to local minima of the learned energy surface, effectively producing stable, physically consistent crystalline structures. The approach ensures the generated configurations respect the physical symmetries both during diffusion and reconstruction, leveraging the chain rule to differentiate the energy function regarding atomic positions while maintaining invariance constraints.

The parameters of this energy model are then embedded within a neural network architecture designed to enforce invariance, such as a symmetry-aware message passing graph neural network, resulting in a differentiable, smooth energy landscape over the configuration space conditioned on invariant descriptors of the material. Inspired by the core idea of the chain rule and differential invariance, we define a stochastic diffusion process over the energy parameters: at each timestep, the parameters undergo a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that perturbs them within the invariant parameter space, employing a well-calibrated diffusion coefficient to ensure broad sampling while preserving invariance constraints. To enforce symmetry during diffusion, we implement explicit projection steps after each diffusion update\u2014projecting the parameters onto an invariant subspace\u2014or incorporate regularization terms into the diffusion process that penalize deviations from invariance, ensuring the process remains physically consistent. This process results in a distribution over energy functions conditioned on the invariant descriptors, thus capturing diverse energetically plausible structures. Once the diffusion process concludes, the learned (or sampled) energy function is used for gradient-based structural optimization: starting from a random atomic configuration, we perform a local energy minimization using algorithms like L-BFGS or conjugate gradient descent, where the energy gradients are computed via automatic differentiation of the neural network.

The core methodology involves constructing an invariant energy landscape represented via a basis expansion, specifically using spherical harmonics up to a maximum degree L_max=6, expressed as E(r) = \u2211_{l=0}^{6} \u2211_{m=-l}^{l} c_{lm} Y_{lm}(\theta, \rho), where c_{lm} are energy coefficients and (\u03b8, \u03c1) are angular variables describing atomic arrangements. A neural network with three message-passing layers of 64 units each and ReLU activations is trained to predict these coefficients conditioned on local atomic environments, incorporating symmetry-invariant features such as rotationally invariant eigenvalues of the local environment tensors.

During diffusion, invariance constraints are enforced via periodic projection: at each step, the ongoing representation undergoes a projection onto the invariant subspace using singular value decomposition (SVD), removing components that would violate invariance. This ensures diffusion occurs within the space of physically meaningful, symmetric energy landscapes. After the diffusion process produces a set of energy parameters, the structure reconstruction involves gradient-based optimization minimizing E(r) with respect to atomic positions r, subject to constraints enforcing periodicity and physical plausibility, with gradients computed via automatic differentiation of the neural energy model. The reconstructed structure is then validated through preliminary phonon calculations to assess vibrational stability and chemical validity checks to confirm plausible bonding.

The previous methods involve diffusion models operating in a descriptor space that respects the structure's invariances, with reconstruction through gradient-based optimization, emphasizing physics-informed descriptors and symmetry preservation. Prior hypotheses have combined this inspiration by explicitly modeling the diffusion in an invariant descriptor space and detailed the reconstruction process. To generate a new hypothesis that is distinct in methodology, I propose leveraging a generative process that combines a variational approach with the diffusion-inspired descriptor space, aiming to produce a latent representation that encodes the entire crystalline structure with its physical and symmetry constraints. This involves creating a stochastic latent space guided by a diffusion process in the descriptor space, while training a variational model to learn an approximate posterior distribution over this space, enabling efficient sampling of plausible structures. The process starts with encoding known or hypothetical structures into invariant descriptors, then using a diffusion process in this descriptor space to model the transformation from noise to meaningful representations, guided by the learned variational model. During generation, sampling from the latent distribution is used as a prior, which is then progressively denoised through the diffusion steps to obtain a descriptor representation. Reconstruction from this descriptor involves gradient-based optimization constrained by symmetry invariance, ensuring physical plausibility. This approach differs from previous hypotheses by integrating a probabilistic latent space with the diffusion model, enabling stochastic sampling that accounts for model uncertainty and diversity of generated structures. It emphasizes a Bayesian framework to model the structure space, rather than purely deterministic diffusion in invariant descriptors, offering enhanced control of structural validity, diversity, and stability. This mechanistic design allows explicit incorporation of physical constraints during both the latent space modeling and reconstruction phases, supporting the generation of stable and realistic crystalline materials. The hypothesis remains mechanistically feasible, as it combines existing techniques in variational inference, diffusion modeling, and physics-based descriptor encoding, adapted specifically for crystalline materials. It avoids the direct use of conventional ML-based generative models, focusing instead on a physics-informed probabilistic diffusion approach embedded within a variational framework, thus ensuring novelty and methodological rigor.", "We propose a novel generative framework that combines variational inference with representation-space diffusion to design crystalline materials. First, we encode existing crystal structures into invariant, differentiable descriptors that respect symmetry, periodicity, and invariances. These descriptors serve as the latent space for the variational autoencoder (VAE), where an encoder neural network maps the descriptors to a low-dimensional latent distribution characterized by mean and variance parameters, approximating the posterior distribution over latent variables. During training, a diffusion process is employed in the descriptor space, modeled as a stochastic Markov chain, which gradually transforms a sample from the prior distribution into the encoded descriptor, guided by learned denoising neural networks conditioned on the descriptive features. The VAE's decoder network learns to reconstruct the original descriptors from the latent variables, enforcing physical and symmetry constraints during reconstruction through gradient-based optimization constrained to invariant subspaces. The loss function comprises a reconstruction term (mean squared error in descriptor space), a KL divergence term to regularize the latent distribution toward the prior, and invariance-enforcing penalties derived from symmetry considerations. At inference, the model samples from the prior latent distribution, then applies the diffusion process in the descriptor space, gradually denoising the initial noise into a physically meaningful descriptor that encodes a potential crystal structure. This descriptor is reconstructed into atomic positions via the trained decoder, followed by gradient-based refinement constrained by physical invariants, to generate stable, unique, and realistic crystalline materials.

The approach begins with encoding known crystal structures using atom-centered Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors with a cutoff radius of 6 \u00c5, generated via established parameters (e.g., radial basis of 8, angular quantum number limit of 12). These descriptors serve as invariant representations, capturing local atomic environments while maintaining rotational, translational, and permutational invariances. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 4 hidden layers and 128 neurons each, using ReLU activations, is trained as the encoder to learn an approximate posterior distribution over the latent space, constraining it with physical invariances, and a symmetric decoder reconstructs the descriptors. During training, the reconstruction loss combines mean squared error (MSE) between original and reconstructed descriptors with a KL divergence term, optimized with Adam over 100 epochs at a learning rate of 1e-4, and a batch size of 32. The diffusion process is defined within the learned latent space, employing a cosine noise schedule over 100 steps, where each forward step adds Gaussian noise with variance following the schedule; the reverse denoising process is parameterized by a neural network conditioned on the current noisy latent, trained to predict the added noise, effectively teaching the model to denoise stepwise from pure noise to latent representations. This setup models the distribution of descriptor representations conditioned on physical invariances, enabling the generation of new latent vectors via iterative denoising starting from Gaussian noise. To reconstruct physically meaningful crystal structures, a gradient-based optimization procedure is employed. Given a sampled latent vector, the decoder predicts corresponding descriptors, which are then optimized with respect to atomic positions using projected gradient descent constrained to the symmetry manifold\u2014enforcing translation, rotation, and permutation invariances via invariant features and symmetry-aware loss functions. The optimized descriptors are then decoded back into atomic positions by solving an inverse problem, with multiple restarts to avoid local minima. The reconstructed structures are then validated through first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess stability, and properties such as formation energy and elastic moduli are predicted using trained surrogate models. Diversity is quantified via structural similarity indices and property distributions, ensuring the generated materials are varied yet physically plausible.

The core idea revolves around defining a physics-informed, invariant descriptor space (e.g., SOAP descriptors) that effectively encodes periodic crystal structures. A differentiable, denoising diffusion process is implemented within this descriptor space, with explicit stochastic steps and schedule parameters to explore structural variations while preserving physical invariances such as rotational, translational, and permutational symmetries. During diffusion, projection techniques (e.g., SVD-based) are applied to continuously enforce these invariances, ensuring chemically valid and physically plausible representations.

This approach involves firstly encoding candidate structures into a continuous, high-dimensional descriptor space that captures the periodic symmetries, chemical composition, and local atomic environments. A stochastic denoising diffusion process is then applied within this descriptor space, with explicitly parameterized noise schedules and a projection step utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD) or similar techniques to enforce invariance constraints such as rotational, translational, and permutational symmetries at each diffusion step. This ensures that each intermediate state remains physically meaningful and symmetry compliant. Following the diffusion phase, an inverse reconstruction procedure employs gradient-based optimization to map the descriptors back into Cartesian atomic positions, optimizing a physically motivated loss function that considers interatomic distances, periodic boundary conditions, and total energy approximations.

First, the process encodes periodic crystal structures into a physics-informed, symmetry-preserving descriptor space using SOAP descriptors, which encode local atomic environments and inherently respect rotational, translational, and permutational invariances. These descriptors are crafted with specific parameters\u2014such as cutoff radii (e.g., 3.0 \u00c5), maximum degree of spherical harmonics, and element-specific weighting factors\u2014to optimally represent the chemical and structural diversity of target materials. The diffusion process operates within this descriptor space, modeled as an isotropic Gaussian diffusion with a configurable schedule\u2014either cosine or linear\u2014over a fixed number of discrete steps (e.g., 1000). During each diffusion step, stochastic noise is added to the descriptors, simulating structural exploration. Crucially, after each diffusion step, a projection via singular value decomposition (SVD) ensures invariance constraints are strictly enforced: the descriptors are orthogonally projected onto the space of symmetry-invariant representations, maintaining physical consistency. This projection involves decomposing descriptor matrices, truncating or constraining singular values to uphold invariance, and reconstructing the projected descriptors efficiently. The stochastic diffusion thus explores the structure space while maintaining invariance, avoiding drift outside physically meaningful regions. Upon completing the diffusion, a gradient-based optimization reconstructs atomic coordinates by minimizing a physically motivated loss function\u2014incorporating interatomic distances, periodic boundary conditions, and energy estimations from classical force fields or surrogate models\u2014using algorithms such as L-BFGS or Adam with regularization to prevent unphysical configurations.

The diffusion process involves gradually corrupting these descriptors over 1000 timesteps guided by a cosine schedule, starting from random noise or a known structure, with the noise level calibrated to balance exploration and stability. At each step, an orthogonal projection via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) enforces the invariance constraints, projecting the diffused descriptors onto physically meaningful, symmetry-compliant subspaces, thus maintaining invariance during stochastic exploration. The diffusion process is executed via a neural network modeled with residual layers and attention modules, trained with an appropriate loss function such as mean squared error (MSE) in the descriptor space, optimized with Adam over multiple epochs, with batch sizes adjusted to accommodate computational constraints. After the diffusion phase, structural reconstruction of atomic positions involves a gradient-based optimization procedure (using Adam or L-BFGS) that minimizes a composite energy function combining a learned potential energy surface\u2014parameterized, for example, by a graph neural network\u2014and a descriptor similarity term, incorporating periodic boundary conditions and physical constraints to ensure the generated structures are physically feasible and stable.

Crystal symmetry is explicitly represented by encoding the asymmetric unit's fractional coordinates and lattice vectors, as well as the associated space group operations, which are parameterized via continuous, interpretable transformation tensors in a manner compatible with the model architecture.\n\nOur diffusion process operates directly on these descriptors: starting from a dataset of known structures, we add Gaussian noise with a schedule of 1000 steps following a variance increasing schedule tailored for descriptors of this complexity, to obtain noised versions of the structures. A neural network backbone based on SE(3)-equivariant residual convolutional layers with attention modules is trained to denoise these descriptors, incorporating loss functions that include mean squared error for descriptor reconstruction, and auxiliary penalties enforcing chemical validity, bonding constraints, and symmetry conformity. During training, the model learns to generate the denoised, symmetry-preserving descriptors conditioned on the noisy inputs, effectively capturing the joint distribution of the asymmetric units and the associated symmetry transformations across different space groups.\n\nGeneration involves sampling from a prior Gaussian distribution in the descriptor space and iteratively denoising via the learned network, producing a set of descriptors representing a prospective asymmetric unit and its symmetry operations. The reconstruction phase employs gradient-based optimization minimizing a combined loss: a descriptor fidelity term, chemical validity constraints (e.g., BondValenceSum, electrostatic stability), and symmetry invariance constraints, to derive Cartesian atomic positions and lattice parameters. During this process, physical invariances such as translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries are explicitly enforced through boundary conditions and regularizations.\n\nThis approach distinctly advances current methods by utilizing a high-fidelity, physics-informed descriptor space as a generative domain, rather than Cartesian or raw coordinate space, simplifying the retention of symmetry and periodicity during generation. By explicit modeling of asymmetric units and symmetry transformations, the model inherently produces structures conforming to diverse space groups, with high diversity and physical plausibility.\n\nValidation involves multiple metrics: assessing symmetry conformity via space group analysis, chemical validity through stability filters, and structural similarity to known materials using RMSD. The approach offers scalability to large datasets like ICSD and Materials Project, as the descriptor-based representation reduces computational complexity in the generation process. Implementation supports diverse symmetry groups due to parameterized symmetry representations and a flexible neural architecture.\n\nThis systematic, detailed, and operationally feasible framework aims to significantly improve the quality, diversity, and physical realism of generated crystalline materials, providing a scalable tool for accelerated materials discovery in top-tier research.", "The presented hypotheses and reasoning outline an ambitious and detailed approach for generative modeling of crystalline materials that integrates invariance-preserving diffusion processes with explicit symmetry modeling.

Training involves multi-property conditioning, enabling targeted generation of structures with desired properties (e.g., band gap, stability).
