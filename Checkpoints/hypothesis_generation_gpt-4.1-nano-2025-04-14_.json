Crosslinking parameters (e.g., polymer concentration, calcium content) are optimized to ensure an elongation exceeding 200% and mechanical robustness.\n\nThe operating principle hinges on the temperature-triggered conformational transitions of the copolymer: azobenzene units undergo trans-cis isomerization (~37\u00b0C threshold), and PNIPAM segments collapse or swell around their lower critical solution temperature (~32\u00b0C). When a thermal gradient (~2\u20135\u00b0C)\u2014simulating body heat\u2014is applied, localized heating above these thresholds induces azobenzene isomerization from trans to cis, and PNIPAM transition from swollen to collapsed states. This shift causes a change in the dielectric environment and hydrogen-bonding network around ferri/ferrocyanide redox ions, as spectroscopic evidence (UV-Vis and IR) will confirm the isomerization and phase transition states, while NMR-DOSY characterizes ion mobility.\n\nThe conformational change leads to a redistribution of solvent molecules and modification of the solvation shell\u2019s asymmetry and rigidity around the redox ions, thereby increasing the entropy change (\u0394S) associated with their redox reactions. This modulation enhances the electrochemical thermopower, measurable as an increased Seebeck coefficient, which is quantified via cyclic voltammetry and open-circuit voltage under small temperature gradients. Reversibility is ensured by cyclic thermal stimuli\u2014heating and cooling\u2014while spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements confirm consistency over multiple cycles.\n\nAdditional characterization\u2014via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy\u2014tracks ionic conductivity and internal resistance changes during phase transitions, while mechanical testing confirms the hydrogel\u2019s flexibility and durability under bending and stretching. The approach leverages the reversible conformational switching of the conjugated copolymer to dynamically control local solvation environments and entropy, directly tuning thermopower for enhanced device performance.

The methodology involves preparing a homogeneous PVA solution by dissolving 12 wt% of high-molecular-weight (89,000\u2013146,000 g/mol, >98% hydrolyzed) PVA in ultrapure water at 90\u00b0C under magnetic stirring at 500 rpm for 1 hour, ensuring complete dissolution. To this solution, a molar mixture of monovalent salts (CsI and KCl) at a 1:1 molar ratio, totaling 1 M concentration, is added gradually to ensure uniform distribution. During stirring, the solution is transferred into a sealed mold.\n\nPhase separation is induced by slow cooling from 90\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C at a rate of 1\u00b0C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent oxidation. Concurrently, a secondary aqueous solution containing 0.05 M of multivalent ions (Al3+ or Fe3+) is injected dropwise into the mixture at around 60\u00b0C to promote localized ionic crosslinking in specific regions as the temperature drops, creating gradients in crosslink density. The combined effects of temperature change and ionic doping lead to macroscopic heterogeneity characterized by denser, ionic crosslinked domains in certain regions and more mobile, monovalent ion-rich regions elsewhere. The homogeneous state transitions into a stabilized gradient structure with domain sizes approximately between 50 nm and 300 nm, as confirmed by confocal microscopy using fluorescently labeled ions and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements.\n\nPost-gelation, the hydrogel undergoes mild annealing at 50\u00b0C for 2 hours in sealed conditions to improve structural stability while preserving the gradient morphology. Mechanical properties are measured using uniaxial tensile tests on samples with standardized dimensions (e.g., 10 mm width, 20 mm length, 2 mm thickness) at a strain rate of 10 mm/min; cyclic bending tests are conducted at 20% strain for 1000 cycles. The hydrogel\u2019s mechanical integrity is monitored via stress-strain curves and recovery ratios.\n\nElectrical and thermoelectric properties are characterized through impedance spectroscopy at room temperature and body temperature (25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C), with platinum electrodes attached on opposite sides of the hydrogel.

The ionic Seebeck coefficient is measured under a controlled temperature differential (\u0394T of 5\u201320\u00b0C) applied via a Peltier device, with voltage stabilization criteria (steady voltage after 10 minutes) to ensure reproducibility.\n\nMechanistically, the gradient structure results from the increased ionic crosslinking density in certain regions due to multivalent ions, which reinforce the network\u2019s stiffness and mechanical resilience, while the more loosely crosslinked, monovalent ion-rich regions facilitate efficient ion migration under a temperature gradient. The multivalent ions (Al3+ or Fe3+) form reversible ionic bonds with hydroxyl groups of PVA, creating crosslinked, stiff zones that resist deformation. Meanwhile, the monovalent Cs+ and K+ ions contribute to thermally driven ionic flux owing to high mobility and large Soret effect contributions.

The core layer consists of a covalently crosslinked polymer network formed by UV-initiated copolymerization of acrylated poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, with approximately 2 molar ratio of acrylate groups per repeat unit) and elastomeric acrylate-functionalized poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), reinforced with 0.5 wt% graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets (lateral size 1\u20135 \u03bcm, functionalized with carboxyl groups) to enhance ionic pathways. This core is fabricated via UV exposure for 10 minutes with 0.1 wt% photoinitiator (Irgacure 2959), forming a dense covalent crosslink network (~5 mmol of crosslinks per gram, measured via swelling equilibrium). The core thickness is targeted at ~150 \u03bcm for optimal balance of conductivity and mechanical integrity.\n\nSurrounding the core is a gradient intermediate layer created through layer-by-layer casting of a chelating polymer solution containing acrylic-modified PVA (4 wt%), calcium chloride (CaCl\u2082, variable concentration), and water (solvent). The chelating ionic crosslinks are formed by soaking the cast layer in CaCl\u2082 solutions of decreasing molarity (e.g., 1 M at the interface, tapering to 0.1 M at the outer surface) over 1 hour, enabling a gradient of reversible ionic bonds (calcium-carboxylate) that serve as sacrificial, energy-dissipating bonds. This layer is approximately 100 \u03bcm thick.\n\nThe outermost surface layer comprises a loosely crosslinked hydrogel with abundant hydrogen bonds and weak ionic interactions, achieved by blending poly(vinyl alcohol) with 10 wt% of phenylboronic acid-functionalized poly(acrylamide), resulting in a network with ~0.2 mol% covalent crosslinks and high water content (~90 wt%). This layer is infused with flexible graphene flakes (~1 wt%, lateral dimensions ~2 \u03bcm) and silver nanowires (~0.5 wt%) to ensure high thermal conductivity (target <10 W/m\u00b7K) for thermogalvanic efficiency while preserving flexibility.

To facilitate reversible ionic bonding, bisphosphonate-based chelating groups are grafted onto the polymer backbone at a defined molar ratio.\n\nNext, a patterned UV exposure is performed using a photomask with defined spatial resolution (10\u201350 \u03bcm). The exposure conditions are calibrated to initiate copolymerization in defined regions with control over exposure time (e.g., 60 seconds at 365 nm wavelength, 10 mW/cm\u00b2 intensity), creating localized zones of higher crosslink density and functionalization. During this step, UV intensity and exposure duration are optimized to produce a gradient or discrete patterns that modulate network density and functionality.\n\nPost-polymerization, the hydrogel is immersed in a 10 mM calcium chloride (CaCl\u2082) solution for 1 hour, facilitating calcium ion diffusion into unexposed regions. Ionic crosslinking occurs via Ca\u00b2\u207a binding to the chelating groups, with spatial control achieved by applying physical barriers or localized heating (~40\u202f\u00b0C) to direct diffusion pathways.
